## Overview

This is a game called asteroid dodger in which the objective is to dodge astoroids, gaining points in the process. It is made with Unity version 5.3.

## Funtionality
Using the touchscreen on a mobile or arrow keys on a keyboard you move the Ship from left to right. When an asteroid falls to bottom of the screen you gain a point. Getting hit by an asteroid causes a gameover and allows a Restart. The game also tracks the highscore of the game
